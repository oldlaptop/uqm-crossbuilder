This directory contains shellscripts used to download and crossbuild
UQM's build dependencies during the process of building this live image.

None of the files in this directory should be run directly, please run
/usr/bin/build-uqm-dependencies.sh instead if you must reinstall UQM
build dependencies in a running image. If you are looking at the live-build
sources and intend to build a copy of this image, you do not need to do anything;
these scripts are executed automatically during the build process.
