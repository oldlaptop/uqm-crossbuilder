The sources in this directory were downloaded, unpacked, cross-compiled, and
installed under /usr/i686-w64-mingw32 during the process of preparing this live
image, and are included here for reference. If you wish to compile and install
these sources with different build flags, or with your own modifications, your
best bet is to generate a new live image; please contact oldlaptop on Freenode
for assistance.
