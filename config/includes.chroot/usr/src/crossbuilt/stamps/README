If you've never heard of 'stamps', these are empty files touch(1)ed by a
makefile during the build process to indicate a package has been built
(so that make(1)'s dependency resolver will consider the dependency met).

If you wanted to rebuild all of the libraries in a running live system,
you could delete these files to force the build process to consider them
un-built. If you're reading the uqm-crossbuilder sources, there is nothing
to see here.
