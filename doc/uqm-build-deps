The process for automatically crossbuilding libraries now has three steps:

 * live-build calls build-uqm-dependencies.chroot, which sets up the environment
   and executes the next two steps.
   
 * build-uqm-depencencies.chroot calls depengine.py with a list of needed
   libraries. depengine.py resolves dependencies (making sure all libraries
   have their dependencies installed before we try to build them), and writes
   a list of build scripts to a temporary file.
   
 * Finally, we abuse head/tail and backtick substitution to run each build
   script specified in the temporary file. These build scripts each download,
   build, and install one library.
