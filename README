This is a live-build configuration intended to cross-build UQM for Windows 
within a VM. It is however designed with modification in mind and should be 
easily adaptable to different host systems and different programs.

To build a hybrid (CD/DVD/USB stick) ISO from these files:

1) install live-build: 
http://live.debian.net/manual-3.x/html/live-manual.en.html#100

2) Run 'lb config' from within this repo's root
3) Run 'lb build' to create the ISO (must have root/fakeroot)

Prebuilt ISOs are available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/uqm-crossbuilder/files/
